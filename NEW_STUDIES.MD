# My Education

This page will track my learning progress. My goal is to maximize my professional skills in 6 main areas:

1. Computer science and software development
2. Animation, digital art, and computer graphics programming
3. Math and physics
4. Theme park design, PLCs, and embedded systems
5. Cybersecurity
6. Creative writing

I will use a Google Sheet and a Trello board to organize the minutia of my process.

## Formal Education

- B.S., Computer Science: Animation Emphasis.
- Minors in Creative Writing and Mathematics.
- M.S., Computer Science. 

## Learning, Phase 1: Core Competency
*The goal of this section is to complete a sequence of courses, projects, and certifications that will solidify my fundamental skills in the above areas.*

## Learning, Phase 2: Advanced

*This section will mostly be a list of potential ideas of what to study, to be better organized once phase 1 is complete.*
