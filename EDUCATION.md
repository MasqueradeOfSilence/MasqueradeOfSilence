**Education** 
- 
Here, I will place the list of all my (relevant) formal coursework. Due to academic honesty policies, most of the repositories will remain private, with the exception of certain classes in which public GitHub repositories were required by the professor -- or, in some classes, labs that have since been discontinued, such as Super Asteroids. 

Regardless, I think it will be nice to have everything organized, in one place, instead of a bunch of repos sitting haphazardly on my profile. 

I will be building this page up gradually. More to come.
