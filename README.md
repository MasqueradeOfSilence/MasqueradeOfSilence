# Intro

Computer graphics programmer, with strong secondary interests in cybersecurity and PLCs. I majored in Computer Science with an emphasis in Animation, and double minored in Creative Writing and Mathematics.

I am currently working towards my master's degree in Computer Science. My primary research interest is computational fluid simulation.

I have worked in software engineering, web development, mobile app development, visual effects, networking and tech support, and computer science research.

I am the president of the Theme Park Engineering and Design club at my university. I have also worked in visual effects on three student films.
