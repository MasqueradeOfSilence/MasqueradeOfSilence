# Intro

Computer graphics programmer, with strong secondary interests in cybersecurity and themed entertainment technology (i.e. PLCs and show control). I majored in Computer Science with an emphasis in Animation, and double minored in Creative Writing and Mathematics.

I am currently working towards my master's degree in Computer Science. My primary research interest is computational fluid simulation and foam.

I have worked in software engineering, web development, mobile app development, visual effects, networking and tech support, and computer science research. I am currently working as a TD (tech artist) in the animation industry. 

I am the president of the Theme Park Engineering and Design club at my university. I have also worked in visual effects on three student films and as a TD on one industry film. 

# Current progress in M.S. 

- Goal is to finish in 2023, ideally by April. 
- Implemented a fluid solver using the Marker and Cell Method.  
- Implemented a second fluid solver using MLS-MPM in Unity using NiallTL's Incremental MPM tutorial.
- Now exploring applications of the MLS-MPM method to low-density foam.
