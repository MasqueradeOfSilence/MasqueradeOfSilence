# Intro

Computer graphics programmer, with strong secondary interests in cybersecurity, web/mobile/game development, and industrial controls for the themed entertainment industry. I majored in Computer Science with an emphasis in Animation, and double minored in Creative Writing and Mathematics.

I have recently completed my master's degree in Computer Science. My primary research interest is computational fluid simulation and foam.

I have worked in software engineering, web development, mobile app development, visual effects, networking and tech support, and computer science research. 

I was the president of the Theme Park Engineering and Design club at my university. I have also worked in visual effects on three student films and as a TD (tech artist) on one industry film, Trolls Band Together. 

# Personal Work and Project List
