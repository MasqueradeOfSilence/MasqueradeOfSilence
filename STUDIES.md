# Personal Work

This is my directory for my self-study and personal projects, organized by area of study. My goal is to develop a strong foundation in each area of computer science that I find interesting. 

For my academic coursework, please check out [ACADEMIA.md](ACADEMIA.md). There will be some degree of overlap between the two, since I am using my coursework as a loose guide for my self-study.
