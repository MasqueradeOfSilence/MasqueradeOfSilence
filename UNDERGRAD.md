**Undergraduate Degree: Computer Science (Animation Emphasis)**

In January of 2015, I began working part-time as a Network Operations Analyst for BYU Office of Information Technology. That same month, I officially entered the premajor for Computer Science: Animation Emphasis. 

I was accepted into the major in May of 2017, and completed my undergraduate coursework in April of 2019.
