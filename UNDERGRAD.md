**Undergraduate Degree: Computer Science (Animation Emphasis)**
- 
In January of 2015, I began working part-time as a Network Operations Analyst for BYU Office of Information Technology. That same month, I officially entered the premajor for Computer Science: Animation Emphasis. I added the creative writing minor in 2015, and the mathematics minor in spring of 2016. 

I became a teaching assistant for CS 240: Advanced Programming Concepts in August of 2016. I was accepted into Computer Science Animation Emphasis in May of 2017. And I interned in the streaming media industry (Sling TV) in the summer of 2018. 

I completed my undergraduate coursework and received my B.S. degree in April of 2019.
