# Arithmetic: Write-Up
On May 21st, 2022, I finished my review of Arithmetic on Khan Academy. I am planning on reviewing each topic section under Khan Academy mathematics, physics, and engineering (skipping the grade-specific ones). 

The motivation for this was to ensure that I did not have any holes in my mathematical understanding.

This was remarkably easy, and it took me way longer than it should have, simply due to the sheer quantity of material. I will need to advance much more quickly through the rest of Khan's curriculum. 

Tips:

- Watch everything at 2x speed.
