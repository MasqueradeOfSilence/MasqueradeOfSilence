# Arithmetic: Write-Up
On May 21st, 2022, I finished my review of Arithmetic on Khan Academy. I am planning on reviewing each topic section under Khan Academy mathematics, physics, and electrical engineering (skipping the grade-specific ones). I call this the Khan Challenge, and I'm aiming for a soft deadline of June 15th, with a hard deadline of June 30th, to finish it. 

The motivation for this was to ensure that I did not have any holes in my mathematical understanding.

This was remarkably easy, and it took me way longer than it should have, simply due to the sheer quantity of material. I will need to advance much more quickly through the rest of Khan's curriculum. 

Tips:

- Watch everything at 2x speed.
