# Early Math: Write-Up
On June 27th, 2021, I finished my review of Early Math on Khan Academy. I am planning on reviewing each topic section under Khan Academy mathematics, physics, and engineering (skipping the grade-specific ones). 

The motivation for this was to ensure that I did not have any holes in my mathematical understanding while preparing for more intensive graduate-level computer science courses in the fall. 

My main takeaways are as follows: 
- You may have weird flashbacks to elementary school. 
- Most of the material is so easy that you will end up spacing out during certain videos, or making silly mistakes during certain quizzes because you were flying through the material too quickly. 
- If you make one of these silly mistakes, you may have to retake a unit test multiple times before the randomizer algorithm actually gives you a question from your area of "weakness". This can be frustrating. 
- You will get WAY better at mental math, number sense, and general logical reasoning, even though doing these simple modules. 
- Growing up, I never understood the concepts of borrowing and carrying -- they were simply taught to me as steps to memorize. Sal was able to teach me how they actually work. More details on that (here)[https://undeadcheese.blogspot.com/2021/05/how-regrouping-in-addition-actually.html].
- My biggest mistake was taking forever to get through this module in tiny little chunks when it was so easy. I should have just set aside a cloudy Sunday and pushed through it all at once.
