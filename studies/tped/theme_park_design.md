# Theme Park Design on Udemy: Write-Up

There is a lack of formal theme park design training programs, in general. They're not entirely nonexistent, but I needed something that provided a good, gentle overview of the industry as a whole. Sometime in 2019 I decided to do Steve Alcorn's theme park design course on Udemy. However, I did not complete it until 2022 due to a various slew of commitments. This month I decided to crack down and finish it so I could move onto my PLC studies. 

I appreciated this course especially due to Steve's experience in show control. This is great for those of us who are looking to get into the industry through the EE/CS/CE side of things. On occasion I still wonder if it would've been better to study computer engineering, but I do not regret studying CS Animation at all, as it was a great program and my goals to be a great programmer and artist have not changed in the slightest. However, this may be something to look into for the future, for further education. 

My only qualm with this course is that Steve seems to take a strange pleasure in staying up until 2 AM the night before an attraction is opened. This is emphasized repeatedly. However, he's a great storyteller and teacher, and the course is captivating from beginning to end. It is also longer than the 6.5 hours of video would have you believe, due to the supplemental reading constituting an entire book, and the two long tribute videos to old attractions that are linked (I would recommend watching them at 2x speed and multitasking, as I finished a painting while viewing them, but of course it's up to you). Regardless, it should absolutely not take you 3 years to complete!
