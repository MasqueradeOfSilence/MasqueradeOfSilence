# Docker 101 Tutorial: Write-Up

My current workplace uses Docker as part of our CI/CD pipelines. As I had no experience with Docker, and didn't even know what it was, I decided to start the [Docker 101 tutorial](https://www.docker.com/101-tutorial), using Docker Playground. I chose this over Docker Desktop due to not having to install anything; however, I may end up needing to install the software at some point anyway. 

Naturally, Docker is something you can dive very deeply into, and a tutorial is only going to scratch the surface. However, that was my only intent for this tutorial, to scratch the surface of Docker. There was one article the tutorial linked that described more about how containers work in-depth, but it requires a knowledge of operating systems that I do not yet have. As a result, it is something that I will have to revisit later. Furthermore, there was a video linked at the beginning, called "Containers from Scratch", but it was optional and quite lengthy. As a result, I haven't watched it yet. But the tutorial is complete. 

I thought that the tutorial was pretty well-designed. It does hold you hand at many points, but I found that eventually it takes off the training wheels a bit and you have to figure things out on your own, which is good. A few things I happened to notice: 

- Docker Playground will automatically shut down your instance after 4 hours, and there's no way you can prevent this that I know of. As a result, I went to class at least once to find out that much of my progress had been undone when I returned (thankfully the repo helped to mitigate some of this). 
- Sometimes Docker Playground's website will get overloaded and you won't be able to access it. I had to switch gears and work on another ticket, and I was so close to being finished!
- You cannot copy/paste into Docker Playground for some reason, at least not in Chrome. Ergo, do NOT auto-generate a super complicated password to log into Docker. You will hate yourself for it. 
- While I have a nice base understanding now, I will need a *lot* more training in order to feel completely comfortable with Docker. However, the aim of this general overview study is simply to scratch the surface of everything so I get a feel for it, and then delve more deeply into what interests me most. As a result, I have completed my goal for this tutorial.
