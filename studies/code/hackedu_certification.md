# HackedU Certification: Write-Up

As part of my training at BYU ASG, I went through the Web Application Security training through HackedU. I found it to be very valuable and enjoyable to see security from a developer's perspective, combining the knowledge I obtained in IT 567 and CS 465 with more hands-on exercises. 

The biggest takeaways I have are the following: 
- Since the modules are simulated, you won't always have access to all the commands that you think you will. Stay close to the tutorial and you will be fine. 
- Don't be afraid to use the hints. Sometimes the answer to the exercise may seem elusive, but then you peek at the hint and realize how obvious it was.
