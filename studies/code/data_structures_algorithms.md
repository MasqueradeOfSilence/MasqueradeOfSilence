# Data Structures and Algorithms: Write-Up

I reviewed Data Structures and Algorithms. At BYU, I took CS 235 in Spring of 2015. It was a C++ course and the second coding course in the CS Animation premajor. I will eventually be re-coding a few data structures outside of the context of the course, as well as going through the equivalent on MIT OCW, for further review. 

## CS 235
I am keeping this repository private for reasons of academic honesty. Here are the labs that I did: 

### Lab 1: RPG
Creating an RPG game using classes, interfaces, and inheritance.

### Lab 2: Linked List
Implementing a linked list in C++. 

### Lab 3: Shunting Yard
Using the shunting yard algorithm to parse an infix expression and convert it to postfix (Reverse Polish) and/or prefix notation. Also using stacks. 

### Lab 4 (Midterm): Railroad
Using stacks, queues, and deques to simulate a railroad. 

### Lab 5: 3D Maze

Creating a 3D maze solver using recursion. 

### Lab 6: BST

Implementing a binary search tree in C++.

### Lab 7: Maps and Sets
Using maps and sets to organize and update student records.

### Lab 8: Quicksort

Implementing the Quicksort algorithm in C++. 

### Lab 9 (Final): AVL

Implementing an AVL tree in C++.
