# Introduction to Computer Programming: Write-Up

I did a quick review of the fundamentals of programming. At BYU, I took CS 142: Introduction to Computer Programming, a C++ course and the first coding class in the Computer Science: Animation Emphasis premajor. The second piece of this study will be Introduction to Computer Science and Programming on MIT OCW. 

## CS 142
I am keeping this repository private for reasons of academic honesty. Here are the labs that I did: 

### Lab 0: Hello World
Print Hello World to the screen. 

### Lab 1: Do As I'm Doing
Print formatted text to the screen. 

### Lab 2: Pizza
