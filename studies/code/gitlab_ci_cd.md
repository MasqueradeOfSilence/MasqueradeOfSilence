# Gitlab CI/CD Pipeline Tutorial: Write-Up

After completing [this tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/gitlab/index.htm) to understand the basics of Gitlab, I proceeded to actually build a basic CI/CD pipeline using [this tutorial](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/building-a-cicd-pipeline-using-gitlab/). I really appreciated this tutorial. It was simple, well-written, and gave me all the information that I needed. I got the pipeline working pretty quickly using Gitlab SaaS.
