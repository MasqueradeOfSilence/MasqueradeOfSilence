# Adobe XD Tutorial: Write-Up

I was tasked to rewrite my dad's website quite some time ago. However, I found that developing a website for a client with no design document was rather difficult. I made many attempts that I wasn't happy with. As I wanted to learn more about UI/UX prototyping tools anyway, I elected to start learning Adobe XD using their basic tutorial series [here](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/learn/get-started.html). 

Furthermore, at BYU ASG we use Adobe XD specifications for our design references, so I thought it certainly couldn't hurt to learn more about it. 

I found the tutorial to be rather dry and dull, and I ended up watching all the videos at 1.5x speed so it was less of a drag. However, after doing this, I started to get a lot more into it, and I found it beneficial simply to spend time in the software. 

The next step will be actually creating a website prototype in XD and then coding it after the design is approved. 

Important things to note: 
- Creating a rectangle will create a canvas. 
- Not everything on my defaults was the same as the tutorial's. 
- Some of my changes might've been saved to my Adobe Cloud instead of this repository. 
- This took way longer than it should have.
